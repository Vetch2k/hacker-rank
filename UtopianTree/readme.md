## Problem
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.  
Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after  growth cycles?  
For example, if the number of growth cycles is *n = 5*, the calculations are as follows:  
```
Period  Height
0          1
1          2
2          3
3          6
4          7
5          14
```

## Output Format
For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after *n* cycles. Each height must be printed on a new line.

## Sample Input

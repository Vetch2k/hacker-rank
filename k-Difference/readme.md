# Instructions
In this challenge, you will be given an array of integers, each unique within the array, and an integer representing a target difference. Determine the number of pairs of elements in the array that have a difference equal to the target difference.  

# Sample
Input :
```
a = [6, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
k = 2
```
Output :
```
5
```
Explanation :
```
1. ( 6 -  4) = 2
2. ( 4 -  2) = 2
3. ( 8 -  6) = 2
4. (10 -  8) = 2
5. (12 - 10) = 2

So There are 5 pairs have difference equal to k value, which in this case k = 2
